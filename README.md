Adapter to use [IBM-Swift/Kitura-redis](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/Kitura-redis) with [Reswifq](https://github.com/reswifq/reswifq).

## üèÅ Getting Started

#### Import KituraRedisClient into your project using [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager):

``` swift
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "YourProject",
    products: [
      .executable(name: "YourProject", targets: ["YourProject"])
    ],
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/reswifq/redis-client-kitura", .upToNextMajor(from: "1.2.0"))
    ],
    targets: [
      .target(name: "YourProject", dependencies: ["KituraRedisClient"])
    ]
)
```

_**Note:** This will also import some [IBM-Swift/Kitura-redis](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/Kitura-redis) related packages into your project._

#### Create a client and a queue:

```
let client = Redis()

client.connect(host: "localhost", port: 6379) { _ in }

let queue = Reswifq(client: client)
```

For more information on how to use [Reswifq](https://github.com/reswifq/reswifq) and the [IBM-Swift/Kitura-redis](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/Kitura-redis)'s client, please refer to the related documentation.
